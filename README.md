1. **How much data is sent in one run?**
    The publisher calls publish_event five times, sending five Borsh-serialized payloads around 24 bytes each, so 120 bytes total (excluding AMQP framing).
2. **Why do both publisher and subscriber use the same AMQP URL?**
    Both programs connect with amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672 so they target the same RabbitMQ broker instance using identical credentials and network address. By sharing this URI, messages published by the publisher arrive at the exact broker and queue that the subscriber is listening on, enabling reliable communication between them.
